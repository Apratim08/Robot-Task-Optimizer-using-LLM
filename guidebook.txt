### 1. Introduction 
#### Purpose of the Guideline
The primary purpose of this safety guidebook is to provide clear and concise guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of all employees within the factory. It aims to foster a culture of safety, awareness, and responsibility, reducing the likelihood of accidents and injuries.

#### Scope and Applicability
This guidebook applies to all employees, contractors, and visitors within the factory premises. It covers all areas of operation, including production floors, storage areas, and administrative offices.

#### Definitions of Key Terms
- **PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)**: Equipment worn to minimize exposure to hazards.
- **Near Miss**: An incident where no injury, illness, or damage occurred, but had the potential to do so.
- **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)**: A set procedure or instruction to carry out operations safely and efficiently.

### 2. Safety Regulations 
1. **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)**: Workers must wear appropriate PPE at all times. This can include items like safety glasses, hard hats, ear protection, gloves, and steel-toed boots, depending on the nature of their work and the risks involved.

2. **Machine Safety**: Machinery must have safety guards in place, and workers should be trained in proper machine operation. Lockout/tagout procedures should be followed to ensure machines are safely shut off and cannot be started up again while maintenance or repairs are being done.

3. **Chemical Safety**: Proper handling and storage of chemicals is crucial. This includes using appropriate containers, labeling all chemicals clearly, and having Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) accessible for all chemicals used in the workplace.

4. **Fire Safety**: Fire extinguishers should be available and easily accessible. Employees should be trained on how to use them and on general fire evacuation procedures.

5. **Housekeeping**: Keeping work areas clean and free of clutter to prevent trips and falls. Spills should be cleaned up promptly, and walkways should always be clear.

6. **Emergency Exits and Evacuation Routes**: Emergency exits must be clearly marked and kept clear at all times. Evacuation routes should be established and communicated to all employees.

7. **First Aid and Medical Attention**: First aid kits should be easily accessible, and employees should know how to use the contents. Procedures for obtaining medical attention in case of an injury should be clearly outlined.

8. **Training and Education**: Employees must receive regular training on safety procedures, including updates when new equipment or chemicals are introduced into the workplace.

9. **Reporting Accidents and Near Misses**: A system for reporting any accidents, injuries, or 'near misses' should be in place to ensure that risks can be assessed and mitigated.

10. **Ergonomics**: Workstations should be designed to minimize strain and injury. This can include adjustable chairs and tables, ergonomic tools, and regular breaks to reduce repetitive strain injuries.

11. **Sign Symbol**
    - if you see a red triangular symbol in the room, it means you can't pick up the red boxes
